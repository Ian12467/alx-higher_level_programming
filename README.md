# ALX School Higher-level Programming Track

## Description
At ALX School, we learn by doing. We have projects everyday that we have to push on GitHub in order for an automatic review to be done.
This repository contains directories each corresponding to a high-level language project.
These projects are part of the ALX School year 1 curriculum.
In these projects, we cover everything from the basics of Python and Javascript (Node), as well as SQL (with MySQL) to more advanced topics.
